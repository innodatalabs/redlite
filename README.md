An opinionated toolset for testing Conversational Language Models.

## Documentation

<https://innodatalabs.github.io/redlite/>

## Usage

1. Install required dependencies

    ```bash
    pip install redlite[all]
    ```

2. Generate several runs (using Python scripting, see [examples](https://github.com/innodatalabs/redlite/tree/master/samples), and below)

3. Review and compare runs

    ```bash
    redlite server --port <PORT>
    ```

4. Optionally, upload to Zeno

    ```bash
    ZENO_API_KEY=zen_XXXX redlite upload
    ```

## Python API

```python
import os
from redlite import run, load_dataset
from redlite.model.openai_model import OpenAIModel
from redlite.metric import MatchMetric


model = OpenAIModel(api_key=os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"])
dataset = load_dataset("hf:innodatalabs/rt-gsm8k-gaia")
metric = MatchMetric(ignore_case=True, ignore_punct=True, strategy='prefix')

run(model=model, dataset=dataset, metric=metric)
```

Note: the code above uses OpenAI API.
You will need to register with OpenAI and get an API access key, then set it in the environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

## Goals

* simple, easy-to-learn API
* lightweight
* only necessary dependencies
* framework-agnostic (PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, Flax, Jax)
* basic analytic tools included

## Develop

```bash
python -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .[dev,all]
```

Make commands:

* test
* test-server
* lint
* wheel
* docs
* docs-server
* black

## Zeno <zenoml.com> integration

Benchmarks can be uploaded to Zeno interactive AI evaluation platform <hub.zenoml.com>:

```bash
redlite upload --project my-cool-project
```

All tasks will be concatenated and uploaded as a single dataset, with extra fields:

* `task_id`
* `dataset`
* `metric`

All models will be uploaded. If model was not tested on a specific task, a simulated zero-score dataframe is used instead.

Use `task_id` (or `dataset` as appropriate) to create task slices. Slices can be used to
navigate data or create charts.
